# HumhubCertifiedRealModule
This is a Humhub module where admins can certify the person as being a real person when they upload a picture of themselves with the site name and their screen name. 

This module will give the option of having members certified as real people to cut down on spammers. The users will
upload a picture of themselves holding a sign with the site name and their username on it. Once the picture has been uploaded
they will become temporarily verified till one of the admins views the pictures and then certifies them as real. 

Still in development. Please feel free to fork and assist in the process if you'd like.
